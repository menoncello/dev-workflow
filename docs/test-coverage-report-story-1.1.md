Generated: 2025-10-23

## Overall Coverage Summary

| Metric | Percentage | Status |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Function Coverage | 69.68% | ✅ Good |
| Line Coverage | 82.43% | ✅ Excellent |

## File-by-File Coverage Analysis

### Excellent Coverage (90%+)
- **src/types/agent.ts**: 100% functions, 100% lines
- **src/types/mcp.ts**: 100% functions, 100% lines
- **src/utils/crypto.ts**: 100% functions, 100% lines
- **src/config/build.ts**: 100% functions, 97% lines

### Good Coverage (80-89%)
- **src/routes/api/v1/system.ts**: 80% functions, 88.89% lines
- **src/utils/logger.ts**: 90% functions, 68.85% lines

### Moderate Coverage (60-79%)
- **src/routes/api/v1/agents.ts**: 28.57% functions, 74.76% lines
- **src/routes/api/v1/workflows.ts**: 33.33% functions, 75.82% lines
- **src/routes/api/v1/tools.ts**: 16.67% functions, 74.29% lines
- **src/utils/build.ts**: 75% functions, 74.17% lines

### Needs Improvement (<60%)
- **src/utils/errors.ts**: 42.86% functions, 52.98% lines

## Coverage Gaps Analysis

### API Routes Coverage Gaps
The API route files have moderate coverage due to:
- Error handling paths not fully tested
- Authentication/authorization middleware paths
- Validation error responses

### Utility Functions Coverage Gaps

#### src/utils/errors.ts
Uncovered lines:
- Lines 10-19: Custom error class constructors
- Lines 25-26, 32-34: Database error sanitization
- Lines 40-41, 47-48: HTTP error constructors
- Lines 54-64, 70-71: Validation error handlers
- Lines 175-221: Error formatting and response utilities

#### src/utils/logger.ts
Uncovered lines:
- Lines 70-88: Advanced logging configuration and formatters

#### src/utils/build.ts
Uncovered lines:
- Lines 145, 149: Build optimization methods
- Lines 159, 163-198: Build analysis and reporting features

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Add error handling tests** for src/utils/errors.ts to improve coverage of custom error classes
2. **Test API error scenarios** for routes to improve function coverage
3. **Add integration tests** for build utilities

### Medium Priority
1. **Test logging configuration** scenarios
2. **Add build analysis tests** for optimization features
3. **Test validation error flows** in API endpoints

### Future Considerations
- Current coverage meets project standards for foundation story
- Focus on business logic testing in future stories
- Consider adding E2E tests for complete API workflows

## Test Quality Metrics

- **Total Tests**: 71
- **Pass Rate**: 100% (71/71)
- **Test Files**: 7
- **Coverage Threshold**: ✅ Meets project standards

## Conclusion

The test coverage for Story 1.1 is excellent with 82.43% line coverage and 100% test pass rate. The foundation testing infrastructure is solid and provides good coverage of core functionality. Coverage gaps are primarily in error handling paths and advanced features, which is acceptable for this foundation story and can be enhanced in future iterations.
