## Assumptions and Dependencies

### Assumptions

1. Redis/RabbitMQ will be used for message transport
2. PostgreSQL with pgvector for state management
3. Docker and Kubernetes for deployment
4. Node.js/Bun runtime environment
5. WebSocket support for real-time communication

### Dependencies

1. Message transport infrastructure (Redis/RabbitMQ) - Required by 2025-10-24
2. Database infrastructure (PostgreSQL) - Required by 2025-10-24
3. Container orchestration platform (Kubernetes) - Required by 2025-10-25

### Risks to Plan

- **Risk**: Message transport vendor selection delays implementation
  - **Impact**: 2 weeks delay in agent communication testing
  - **Contingency**: Start with in-memory message queue for initial testing

- **Risk**: Performance testing infrastructure not ready
  - **Impact**: Delayed R-004 validation
  - **Contingency**: Use cloud-based load testing service
