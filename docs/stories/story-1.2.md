# Story 1.2: Container & Deployment Infrastructure

Status: Ready

## Story

As a DevOps engineer,
I want containerized deployment configuration,
So that the system can be reliably deployed across environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Docker configuration for multi-stage builds
2. Docker Compose for local development
3. Kubernetes deployment manifests
4. Environment configuration management
5. Database migration automation

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Create Docker configuration for multi-stage builds (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Design multi-stage Dockerfile for development, staging, and production
  - [ ] Optimize layer caching and build performance
  - [ ] Configure health checks and startup probes
  - [ ] Set up proper image tagging and versioning strategy
- [ ] Task 2: Implement Docker Compose for local development (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create docker-compose.yml for local development services
  - [ ] Configure PostgreSQL, Redis, and application containers
  - [ ] Set up volume mounts for development code
  - [ ] Configure environment variables and service dependencies
- [ ] Task 3: Generate Kubernetes deployment manifests (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create deployment, service, and ingress manifests
  - [ ] Configure ConfigMaps and Secrets management
  - [ ] Set up resource limits and health checks
  - [ ] Implement horizontal pod autoscaling configuration
- [ ] Task 4: Establish environment configuration management (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create environment-specific configuration files
  - [ ] Implement secure secrets management
  - [ ] Set up configuration validation and defaults
  - [ ] Document environment setup procedures
- [ ] Task 5: Implement database migration automation (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create database migration scripts with Prisma
  - [ ] Set up automated migration execution in deployment
  - [ ] Configure rollback capabilities for failed migrations
  - [ ] Add database backup and restore procedures

## Dev Notes

- Multi-stage Docker builds for optimal image sizes and security
- Docker Compose orchestration for local development consistency
- Kubernetes manifests for production deployment with scaling
- Environment-specific configuration management with validation
- Database migration automation with Prisma and rollback support
- Container security best practices with health checks and resource limits

### Testing Strategy Alignment

**Container Testing Focus:**
- Container build validation and smoke tests
- Integration testing with Docker Compose
- Environment configuration validation
- Migration testing and rollback verification
- Health check and startup probe testing

**Quality Gates:**
- All container images must pass security scanning
- Environment configurations must be validated
- Migration scripts must be tested on staging
- Kubernetes manifests must pass helm linting
- Docker Compose services must start successfully

### Project Structure Notes

**Target Structure from architecture.md:**
```
dev-plugin/
├── docker-compose.yml              # Local development orchestration
├── docker-compose.prod.yml         # Production deployment
├── Dockerfile                      # Multi-stage container build
├── .env.example                    # Environment variables template
├── k8s/                           # Kubernetes manifests
│   ├── namespace.yaml
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   ├── ingress.yaml
│   ├── configmap.yaml
│   └── secret.yaml
├── scripts/
│   ├── build.sh                    # Production build
│   ├── deploy.sh                   # Deployment script
│   └── migrate.sh                  # Database migration
```

**Lessons Learned from Story 1.1:**
- Follow the established project structure from architecture.md
- Use consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities)
- Implement comprehensive testing for all infrastructure components
- Ensure all configurations are validated and documented
- Maintain security best practices throughout deployment configuration

**No Previous Container Infrastructure:** Story 1.1 established the foundation but did not include container infrastructure.
