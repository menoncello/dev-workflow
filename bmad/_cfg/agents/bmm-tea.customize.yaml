# Customize any section below - all are optional
# After editing: npx bmad-method build <agent-name>

# Override agent name

# Add custom critical actions (appended after standard config loading)
critical_actions:
  - name: test-quality-validation
    description: Ensure generated test code meets quality gates
    instruction: |
      All test code I generate MUST meet these quality gates:
      - TypeScript: Compile with 0 errors in strict mode
      - Biome: Pass with 0 errors (NEVER use eslint-disable comments)
      - Formatting: Follow project Biome conventions
      - Test Runner: Use Bun Test API (describe, it, expect)

      When generating test data and assertions:
      - Use proper TypeScript types (no 'any', infer types correctly)
      - Handle async/await correctly (no floating promises)
      - Follow Biome rules (no-unused-vars, etc.)
      - Structure tests to cover acceptance criteria fully

# Add persistent memories for the agent
memories:
  - key: quality-standards
    value: "All generated test code must meet quality gates: TypeScript 0 errors, Biome 0 errors, proper formatting, use Bun Test API"
  - key: test-tools
    value: "This project uses Bun Test (describe, it, expect) as the test runner with 100% pass rate requirement"
# Example:
# memories:
#   - "User prefers detailed technical explanations"
#   - "Current project uses React and TypeScript"

# Add custom menu items (appended to base menu)
# Don't include * prefix or help/exit - auto-injected
menu: []
# Example:
# menu:
#   - trigger: my-workflow
#     workflow: "{project-root}/custom/my.yaml"
#     description: My custom workflow

# Add custom prompts (for action="#id" handlers)
prompts: []
# Example:
# prompts:
# - id: my-prompt
